In MVC design pattern, a model is an application object which can store the application data. The View represents data in specified ways. Controller is the one that manipulates the model and updates the view.
  
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a set of rules that clients and
servers in a network use for communication. It is a stateless protocol i.e. all the
communications are independent. Server does not need to store any information
about previous communication in order to respond to future requests.
Port 80 is the default port for HTTP services.
GET, POST, DELETE are HTTP methods. GET is used to ask for a
resource from the server. POST is used to send data to the server. DELETE is used
to delete resource on the server. UPDATE is not an HTTP method. PUT is used to
replace the current representation of targeted resource with the payload.
  
An IPv4 address has the format x.x.x.x, where x is called an octet and
must be a decimal value between 0 and 255. Octets are separated by periods. An
IPv4 address must contain three periods and four octets.
192.102.2.1 and 1.2.3.4 are valid IPv4 addresses.
2001:db8::1234:5678 is a valid IPv6 address.
